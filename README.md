# I4 Language Tool

[[_TOC_]]

[LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) is a nice tool to check your text for typos and grammar errors.
One main advantage above [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) is that LanguageTool also supports German and you can set up your own server.
I did this under <https://lang.sse.cit.tum.de>.
You can find all the code necessary to set up this server in this repository.
